# Blog Interfaces

> Interfaces for a blog integration app.

This app provides extensible interfaces that can be used by the `vtex.store` and a theme app. A blog app (either native or a third-party integration) would depend on this app and extend the interfaces provided to become available in the store.

For an example, see the [vtex.wordpress-integration](https://github.com/vtex-apps/wordpress-integration) app.

## Use cases

1. Create store pages for blog posts, blog categories, and blog search results.
2. Add blog-related blocks to product pages and search pages.
